The GDL2 Palette uses runtime introspection to know which Associations/Aspects
are available.  EOInterface has skeleton classes (ready to be implemented)
for all the associations, some of which are incomplete.  So not all
associations creatable with gorm will actually work.

Please see the EOInterface TODO file for a list of implemented association
classes and aspects.

Currently the palette looks for .eomodel or .eomodeld files, in the 
same directory as the .gorm file.  Ideally it would get the list of models from
a project management tool such as Project Manager or Project Center.
Inability to locate a model file would manifest itself as a lack of keys
to bind aspects to.

This tool should also be able to notify Gorm when a model file is changed.
Currently you must quit Gorm and reload the .gorm file when the model changes.
