The GDL2 Palette uses runtime introspection to know which Associations/Aspects
are available.  EOInterface has skeleton classes (ready to be implemented)
for all the associations, some of which are incomplete.  So not everything
creatable with gorm will actually work.

Please see the EOInterface TODO file for a list of implemented association
classes and aspects.
