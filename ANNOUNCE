The GNUstep Database Library 2 Package, version 0.10.1 is now available.

What is the GNUstep Database Library 2 Package?
====================================

The GNUstep Database Library 2 (GDL2) is a set of libraries to map
Objective-C objects to rows of relational database management systems
(RDBMS).  It aims to be compatible with Enterprise Objects Framework
(EOF) as released with WebObjects 4.5 from Apple Inc.  It requires 
- the GNUstep Make Package
- the Base Package
- the GUI Package
- the Back Package
- the GORM Package


The package has been tested on:

Debian Sarge/x86
Debian Etch/x86
Debian Sid/x86 (Sept 2006)

Changes in version 0.10.1
=========================

This followup release only includes packaging issues.  Not all of the
subprojects were installed into the correct GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR
by default.

Changes in version 0.10.0
=========================

This release includes many bug fixes and partial rewrites of
existing implementations and should be more robust that the
previous release.

This release includes new preliminary classes like
EOSharedEditingContext, EOEvent, EOEventCenter and EOMultiReaderLock
but these haven't seen much testing yet and are partially implemented.

This release includes an initial version of EOInterface, the library
or framework to connect GUI elements to GDL2 classes.

Matt Rice contributed an initial DBModeler application, an EOModler
framework implementation, a GDL2Palette for GROM and lots of time
debuging, testing and filling in missing implementations.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
