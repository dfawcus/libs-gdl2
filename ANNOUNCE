The GNUstep Database Library 2 Package, version 0.11.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep Database Library 2 Package?
====================================

The GNUstep Database Library 2 (GDL2) is a set of libraries to map
Objective-C objects to rows of relational database management systems
(RDBMS).  It aims to be compatible with Enterprise Objects Framework
(EOF) as released with WebObjects 4.5 from Apple Inc.  It requires 
- the GNUstep Make Package
- the Base Package
- the GUI Package
- the Back Package
- the GORM Package


The package has been tested on:

Debian Etch/x86

Changes in version 0.11.0
=========================
This release contains the following changes:
- Build as NATIVE_LIBRARY and renamed projects to
  (lib)EOControl, (lib)EOAccess and (lib)EOInterface
- Adaption to the gnustep-make 2.0 infrastructure
- Addition of an SQLiteAdaptor.
- Removed dependency on GC classes.
- Started update of the Postgres95->PostgreSQL adaptor
  (The goal is to migrate to the PostgreSQL 7/8 API and datatypes
   but this is still WIP.)
- Much improved DBModeler application including initial diagram support.
- Much improved GDL2Palette support.
- Improved EODisplayGroup implementation.

- Bug fixes
  - Correct propagation or relationship attributes.
  - Correct determination of seconds and milliseconds in the
    PostgreSQL adaptor
