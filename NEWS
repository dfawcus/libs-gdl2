========================================
This release contains the following changes:
- Fix minor memory management bugs in DBModeler.
- Adapt NSUndoManager handling to new behavior.

The currently released version of the library is `0.12.0'.

'alpha' release 0.12.0
========================================
This release contains the following changes:
- Added Renaissance dependency to ease porting
- Licensed under GNU GPL/LGPL v3
- Added first projects for more complete examples
- Reorganized examples and documentation
- minor compile flag fixes
- improved make 2.0 integration
  to avoid forcing users to link against EOAccess simply to include
  the GDL2 version makefile fragment, users must now expicitly add:
  ADDITIONAL_NATIVE_LIBS+=EOControl EOAccess
  to thier makefiles for tools or:
  ADDITIONAL_NATIVE_LIBS+=EOControl EOAccess EOInterface
  for applications


'alpha' release 0.11.0
========================================

This release contains the following changes:
- Build as NATIVE_LIBRARY and renamed projects to
  (lib)EOControl, (lib)EOAccess and (lib)EOInterface
- Adaption to the gnustep-make 2.0 infrastructure
- Addition of an SQLiteAdaptor.
- Removed dependency on GC classes.
- Started update of the Postgres95->PostgreSQL adaptor
  (The goal is to migrate to the PostgreSQL 7/8 API and datatypes
   but this is still WIP.)
- Much improved DBModeler application including initial diagram support.
- Much improved GDL2Palette support.
- Improved EODisplayGroup implementation.

- Bug fixes
  - Correct propagation or relationship attributes.
  - Correct determination of seconds and milliseconds in the
    PostgreSQL adaptor


'alpha' release 0.10.1
========================================

This release only fixes packaging issues.  Some of the sub projects
were not installed into the the correct GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR.


'alpha' release 0.10.0
========================================

This release includes many bug fixes and partial rewrites of
existing implementations and should be more robust that the
previous release.

This release includes new preliminary classes like
EOSharedEditingContext, EOEvent, EOEventCenter and EOMultiReaderLock
but these haven't seen much testing yet and are partially implemented.

This release includes an initial version of EOInterface, the library
or framework to connect GUI elements to GDL2 classes.

Matt Rice contributed an initial DBModeler application, an EOModler
framework implementation, a GDL2Palette for GROM and lots of time
debuging, testing and filling in missing implementations.


Initial 'alpha' release 0.9.1
========================================

This is the first alpha release package of GDL2.  First and
foremost this is the result of a tremendous effort of 
Mirko Viviani <mirko.viviani@gmail.com> to create a database
library aiming a compatibility with Enterprise Objects Frameworks
from Apple Inc.  It is still missing major components and many of
the existing classes are not fully implemented.  Yet the package
does provide a basis for production level code.  As major
features are completed, they should be mentioned by release in
this file.
