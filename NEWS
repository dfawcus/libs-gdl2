The currently released version of the library is `0.9.1'.

Initial 'alpha' release
========================================

   * This is the first alpha release package of GDL2.  First and
     foremost this is the result of a tremendous effort of 
     Mirko Viviani <mirko.viviani@e-cremona.it> to create a database
     library aiming a compatibility with Enterprise Objects Frameworks
     from Apple Inc.  It is still missing major components and many of
     the existing classes are not fully implemented.  Yet the package
     does provide a basis for production level code.  As major
     features are completed, they should be mentioned by release in
     this file.
