The GNUstep Database Library 2 (GDL2) is a set of libraries to map
Objective-C objects to rows of relational database management systems
(RDBMS).  It aims to be compatible with Enterprise Objects Framework
(EOF) as released with WebObjects 4.5 from Apple Inc.  It requires 
- the GNUstep Make Package 1.13.0
- the Base Package 1.13.0
- the GUI Package 1.11.0
- the Back Package 1.11.0
- the GORM Package 1.1.0

GDL2 consists of the following components:

- EOControl (gnustep-db2control)

The fundamental abstraction library which includes many non RDBMS
related extensions such as KeyValueCoding extensions and other
categories.  Most importantly it contains the classes which handle the
coordination of object graphs namely EOEditingContext.

- EOAccess (gnustep-db2)

This library implements the underlying mechanism to retrieve and store
data in RDBMS.  It defines the abstract classes like EOAdaptor which
are subclassed to interface with concrete RDBMS implementations.

- EOInterface

This library implements classes used to synchronize UI components such
as NSTextFields, NSButtons and NSTableViews with the state of objects
which an EOEditingContext contains.

- EOAdaptors

This is a collection of concrete EOAdaptor projects needed to connect
to specific databases.  GDL2 currently only supplies an Adaptor for
the PostgreSQL database.  Even though the Adaptor is still called
Postgres95 we aim to support PostgreSQL 7.2 and higher API.  In fact
the Adaptor may very soon be renamed to PostgreSQL.

- DBModeler

GDL2 will offers a UI application to create and maintain .eomodel(d)
files.  This is the first release of a preliminary version.

======================
*** Important Note ***
======================

This release is meant for developers who can help test and contribute
the current code or are willing to test the interface.  It is not
ready for general purpose production code.  Having said that, it
should be mentioned that GDL2 is being used in production environments
and has been much tested in those contexts.

Expect the current interface to change especially with respect to
functions and methods not documented in EOF 4.5.  Even the library
names themselves may change.

With respect to EOF, GDL2 is currently missing EOSharedEditingContext,
EOMultiReaderLocks and the EOEvent classes.  Also we currently do not
support the EOSchemaSynchronization methods yet.  But you are likely
to find many more missing implementations within the source.  If you
identify something that you need, please let us know at
<discuss-gnustep@gnu.org> or even better get copyright assignment for
the FSF and post a patch.
