Introduction
============

   Make sure you have installed the GNUstep Makefile package
(gnustep-make) and the GNUstep Base Library (gnustep-base) and you
have sourced the makefile script:
     . $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
If you want support for LoginPanels you also need the GNUstep GUI
Library (gnustep-gui) and the GNUstep Backend Library (gnustep-back)
installed.
   If your installing GDL2 on Cocoa, the GNUstep Base Library should
be installed as a support library (gnustep-baseadd).  GDL2 will use
AppKit so you do not need gnustep-gui or gnustep-back. 
   See the GNUstep-HOWTO in gnustep-make for more information.

   Quick installation instructions:

     ./configure
     make
     make install

Configuration
=============

   Configuration is performed by running the `configure' program at a
shell prompt. You may want to use some of the optional arguments to the
`configure' program. Type `configure --help' for a list of these. It is
not likely that you will need to use the `--prefix' option, since
gnustep-base will automatically install in the directory specified by the
`GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT' environment variable (specified when you
installed gnustep-make).

Compilation
===========

   To compile this library, type make. After this is complete, type make
install. Some additional options you can use with make are `debug=yes'
to make a debugging version of the library and `shared=no' to make a
static version of the library. See the gnustep-make package for more
information on these options.
